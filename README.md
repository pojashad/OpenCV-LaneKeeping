# OpenCV-LaneKeeping
My first attempt on Lane Keeping with OpenCV in C++. Wish me good luck!

### Status
- [x] Region Of Interest (ROI)
- [x] ROI To Grayscale
- [x] ROI To Canny (Edge Detection)
- [x] ROI Gaussian Blur
- [x] ROI Back to BGR
- [x] Merge ROI back to source frame
- [ ] Draw Lanes
- [ ] Remove ROI from source frame and just keep the lanes
- [ ] Feedback from the program to control the vehicle between the lanes
